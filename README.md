# fCC-markdownPreviewer
fCC Challenge - Build a Markdown Previewer

1. Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

    2.1 User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
    
    2.2 User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
    
3. Rule: You must use both SASS and React to build this project
    
3. Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked

4. Note: If you want to use the React JSX syntax, you need to enable 'Babel' as a preprocessor
